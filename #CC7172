    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Poverty is a widespread issue in India, affecting both rural and urban areas differently. This study compares and contrasts these two types of poverty, exploring their causes, impacts, and possible solutions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Poverty Facts in India</h2>
        <p>India has a significant number of impoverished people, with over 270 million living below the national poverty line. Approximately 70% of these individuals live in rural areas, while 30% are in urban settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Rural Poverty</h2>
        <p>Rural poverty is marked by limited access to essentials like clean water, education, and healthcare. It is primarily caused by dependence on agriculture, low productivity, and inadequate infrastructure. Many rural families rely on subsistence farming, which is vulnerable to weather and market fluctuations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Urban Poverty</h2>
        <p>Urban poverty involves issues like overcrowded living conditions, unemployment, and poor public services. Rapid urbanization has led to the growth of slums where many urban poor live. Employment in the unstable informal sector also contributes to urban poverty.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Causes of Rural and Urban Poverty</h2>
        <p>Poverty in rural and urban areas arises from various factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Dependence:</strong> Rural areas heavily rely on agriculture, which can be unproductive and climate-dependent.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Infrastructure:</strong> Inadequate infrastructure like roads, schools, and healthcare in rural areas hinders development.</li>
            <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> Rapid urban growth has led to slum expansion and insufficient public services.</li>
            <li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> High unemployment, particularly in the informal sector, exacerbates urban poverty.</li>
            <li><strong>Education and Skill Gaps:</strong> Lack of quality education and skill development opportunities affects both rural and urban areas.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Comparative Analysis</h2>
        <p>Rural and urban poverty share some common elements, such as inadequate education and healthcare, but also have distinct differences. Rural poverty is often more entrenched due to agricultural issues, while urban poverty is linked to economic transitions and migration. Solutions must be tailored to each context.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Improvement Strategies</h2>
        <p>To reduce poverty, the following steps are essential:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhancing Agricultural Productivity:</strong> Use modern farming techniques and ensure resource access to boost rural incomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving Infrastructure:</strong> Develop roads, schools, and healthcare in rural areas to drive growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Farm Employment:</strong> Create job opportunities outside agriculture to reduce rural poverty.</li>
            <li><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> Implement effective urban planning to tackle urban poverty and slum issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> Provide education and vocational training to improve employability.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Youth's Role in Poverty Alleviation</h2>
        <p>Youth are crucial in combating poverty through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Innovation and Entrepreneurship:</strong> Driving innovation and job creation, especially in tech and startups.</li>
            <li><strong>Advocacy and Awareness:</strong> Raising awareness and advocating for policy changes via social media and community engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Volunteering:</strong> Participating in volunteer programs to directly help the poor.</li>
            <li><strong>Mentoring:</strong> Teaching and mentoring underprivileged children to bridge the education gap.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Political Views and Role</h2>
        <p>Politics significantly influences poverty reduction efforts. The government's role includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Policy Making:</strong> Creating inclusive policies like MGNREGA to provide jobs and improve rural infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Efficiently distributing resources to crucial sectors such as agriculture, education, and urban development.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementing Schemes:</strong> Ensuring effective execution and monitoring of poverty alleviation programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships:</strong> Encouraging collaborations to enhance the reach and impact of poverty reduction initiatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Legislation and Regulation:</strong> Enacting laws that protect the poor's rights and improve living conditions.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Solutions and Policy Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Addressing rural poverty requires improving agricultural productivity, infrastructure, and non-farm employment. Urban poverty solutions involve enhancing living conditions in slums, increasing formal employment, and ensuring access to basic services.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Addressing rural and urban poverty in India needs context-specific solutions. Understanding the unique challenges of each type of poverty can help develop effective strategies. Youth involvement and political commitment are essential for long-term success in poverty alleviation.</p>
